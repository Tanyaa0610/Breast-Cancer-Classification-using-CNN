# Breast-Cancer-Classification-using-CNN
This project successfully demonstrated the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for detecting breast cancer from mammogram images. By taking advantage of CNNs' automated feature extraction and prediction capabilities, the model showed high accuracy and reliability in differentiating between benign and malignant cases.

The model achieved 94% accuracy, with a precision of 92%, recall of 95%, and an F1-score of 93.5%. These results emphasize the potential of CNNs in supporting clinicians with early and accurate cancer diagnosis.
